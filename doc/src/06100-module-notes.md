## Notes {#sec:modules:notes}

The Notes module is intended to keep notes. These notes can be inserted as plain
text, markdown or other markup languages.

The notes module offers:

* adding, removing and settings of tags
* listing notes, optionally filtered by
  * tags
  * grepping through the content of the note
* opening a note via `xdg-open` (rendered as HTML if content is written in
  a markup language)
